		<h1 style=color:maroon;>Welcome, underachiever</h1>
<br/>
		<h2 style=color:gold;>Thank you for applying to Stanford University</h2>
		<p1 style=color:black;>After careful consideration of your application, we do not regret at all to inform you that we are unable to offer your admission to Stanford University at this time. Over 30 million people applied, and only -30 got in(that is to say, 30 were expelled and zero were accepted). If attending Stanford University remains your goal, you should probably get a new goal. We wish you the best of luck in your academic endeavors. If you would like to enter your family income below, we will take that into consideration for appeals (if below 900,000 bitcoin, don't bother): </p1> <br/>
